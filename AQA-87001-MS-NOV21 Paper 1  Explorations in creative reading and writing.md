MARK SCHEME – GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE – 8700/1 – JUNE 2021

Mark schemes are prepared by the Lead Assessment Writer and considered, together with the relevant
questions, by a panel of subject teachers. This mark scheme includes any amendments made at the
standardisation events which all associates participate in and is the scheme which was used by them in
this examination. The standardisation process ensures that the mark scheme covers the students’
responses to questions and that every associate understands and applies it in the same correct way.
As preparation for standardisation each associate analyses a number of students’ scripts. Alternative
answers not already covered by the mark scheme are discussed and legislated for. If, after the
standardisation process, associates encounter unusual answers which have not been raised they are
required to refer these to a Senior Examiner.

It must be stressed that a mark scheme is a working document, in many cases further developed and
expanded on the basis of students’ reactions to a particular paper. Assumptions about future mark
schemes on the basis of one year’s document should be avoided; whilst the guiding principles of
assessment remain constant, details will change, depending on the content of a particular examination
paper.

**Introduction**

The information provided for each question is intended to be a guide to the kind of answers anticipated
and is neither exhaustive nor prescriptive. **All appropriate responses should be given credit.**

**Level of response marking instructions**

Level of response mark schemes for GCSE English Language are broken down into four levels (where
appropriate). In the first column each level is identified with one or two key words that represent the
differences in the skills then described. These key words show the progression from Level 1 to 4 and
are:

Level 4 Perceptive, detailed
Level 3 Clear, relevant
Level 2 Some, attempts
Level 1 Simple, limited.

This is followed in the second column by a description of the different qualities required in the student’s
answer for that level. These are called the skills descriptors. In order to reach a given level, a student
must fulfil one or more of the skills descriptors for that level.

The third column of the mark scheme is the Indicative Standard. This is an important feature of the mark
scheme for GCSE English Language. It provides exemplification of the skills descriptors at each level
and offers a small number of different comments at the required standard to give an indication of the
quality of response that is typical for that level. It shows the progression from Level 1 to 4.

The Indicative Standard is not intended to be a model answer nor a complete response, and it does not
exemplify required content. Students may reach a given level by making **one or more** comments of the
quality demonstrated by the Indicative Standard and do not have to meet all the skill descriptors at that
level.

The standardising scripts will further exemplify each of the levels. You must refer to the standardising
material **throughout your marking**.

**Step 1 Annotate the response**

When marking a response you should first read through the student’s answer and annotate each section
using the comments from the statement bank to show the qualities that are being demonstrated, as
instructed during standardising. You can then award a level and a mark.

**Step 2 Determine a level**

Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and use it as a ladder to see whether the answer meets the
descriptors for that level. The descriptors for the level indicate the different qualities that might be seen in
the student’s answer for that level. If it meets the lowest level then go to the next one and decide if it
meets this level, and so on, until you have a match between the level descriptor and the answer. With
practice and familiarity you will find that for better answers you will be able to quickly skip through the
lower levels of the mark scheme.

The Indicative Standard column in the mark scheme will help you determine the correct level.
Remember, students may reach a given level by making **one or more** comments of the quality
demonstrated by the Indicative Standard and do **not** have to meet all the skill descriptors at that level. It

3

MARK SCHEME – GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE – 8700/1 – JUNE 2021

is not the number of references, but the quality of the comments that will determine the level. The
annotation you added to the script at Step 1 will help you determine the correct level.

**Step 3 Determine a mark**

Once you have assigned a level you need to decide on the mark. This requires you to fine tune within
the level to see how well each of the skills descriptors for that level has been met. A student only has to
meet a skills descriptor at a given level **once** to be awarded that level. Since responses rarely match a
level in all respects, you need to balance out the range of skills achieved and allow strong performance
in some aspects to compensate for other skills that may be only partially fulfilled. Again, the annotation
added at Step 1 will help you determine the mark.

Reference to the standardising scripts throughout the marking period is essential. This will help you
apply the level descriptors accurately and consistently. There will usually be an answer in the
standardising materials which will correspond with each level of the mark scheme. This answer will have
been awarded a mark by the Lead Examiner. You can compare the student’s answer with the example
to determine if it is the same standard, better or worse than the example. You can then use this to
allocate a mark for the answer based on the Lead Examiner’s mark on the example.

You may well need to read back through the answer as you apply the mark scheme to clarify points and
assure yourself that the level and the mark are appropriate.

An answer which contains nothing of relevance to the question must be awarded no marks.

**Advice**

In fairness to students, all examiners must use the same marking methods. The following advice may
seem obvious, but all examiners must follow it closely.

1. Refer constantly to the mark scheme and standardising scripts throughout the marking period.
2. Always credit accurate, relevant and appropriate responses that are not necessarily covered by
the mark scheme or the standardising scripts.
3. Use the full range of marks. Do not hesitate to give full marks if the response merits it.
4. Remember the key to accurate and fair marking is consistency.
5. If you have any doubt about how to allocate marks to a response, consult your Team Leader.

the abstract noun ‘expectation’ to symbolise all
the excitement of the city and his new life
there, as if it were food he can barely swallow.
The prospect is almost ‘too’ overwhelming,
‘too’ thrilling. The suggestion of food could link
back to eating ‘meat’ in the previous sentence,
suggesting that Ugwu cannot literally or
metaphorically absorb the rich food or new
experiences on offer in the city, which
emphasises, by comparison, the poverty of his
own life up until now. |

The writer uses this metaphor to compare his

food, and describes how Ugwu finds it hard to
swallow, because it is so different to what he is
used to. The word “choked” suggests that it
restricts his breath. |

You now need to think about the **whole** of the source.
This text is from the opening of a novel.
How has the writer structured the text to interest you as a reader?
You could write about:

- what the writer focuses your attention on at the beginning of the source
• how and why the writer changes this focus as the source develops
• any other structural features that interest you.

**AO2**

MARK SCHEME – GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE – 8700/1 – JUNE 2021

Explain, comment on and analyse how writers use language and structure to achieve effects and
influence readers, using relevant subject terminology to support their views
This question assesses how the writer has structured a text. Structural features can be: at a whole
text level eg. beginnings/endings/perspective shifts; at a paragraph level eg. topic change/aspects of
cohesion; and at a sentence level when judged to contribute to whole structure.

sense of excitement and anticipation in Ugwu
finding out about his new Master by increasing the
pace of his journey towards this point, then
deliberately slowing the pace as they arrive, to
delay the moment they actually meet. Standing on
the doorstep ‘before the glass door’ is structurally
symbolic as Ugwu stands on the threshold of a new
life, leaving his old life behind, looking through the
glass door to his future. The writer holds him there,
for ‘a brief moment,’ like a freeze frame, to
emphasise this rite of passage. |

compound, and being on the verge of a new life in
the city, is so great that we feel it cannot last, and by
the end of the extract we suspect that the fantasy
may not be so easy to grasp. The description of the
car with ‘a strip of metal... around its blue body like a
necklace’ symbolises the car as an object of desire,
creating a thrilling fantasy of glamour and aspiration
for a boy from a poor village. Ugwu is portrayed by
the writer as so fascinated by the appearance of the
car that he cannot help ‘staring’ at it. He is transfixed
by this vision of modern technology and the beautiful
bodywork which symbolise the promise and thrill of
his new life. |

• Evaluates clearly the

effect(s) on the reader | When Ugwu first sees the car, he realises that there
is a new world of possibilities which is very different
to his old life in the village and he is eager to enjoy it.
The writer uses a simile ‘a strip of metal ran around
its blue body like a necklace’ to create a sense of
how shiny and attractive the car is to Ugwu. The
word ‘necklace’ suggests that the car is glinting like
precious jewellery, which makes it seem like the car
is a very desirable object. She is effective in
portraying Ugwu’s excitement by the description of
his reaction to the car in the garage which shows
how he is entranced by the car and by his new life,
although by the end his excitement has become
uncertainty. |
