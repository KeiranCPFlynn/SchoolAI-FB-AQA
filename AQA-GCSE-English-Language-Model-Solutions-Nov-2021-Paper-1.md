Q2. The writer uses   in order to describe Ugwu’s impression of the city. The simile “side , creates a vivid image of the houses in the reader’s head,
as it creates a   between two imaginable scenarios. It allows the reader to really appreciate the uniformity of the houses and how Ugwu would “never be able to describe” them to his sister, which further emphasises his awe. Moreover, the writer uses the simile “the hedges separating them were trimmed so flat on top that they looked like tables wrapped with leaves” to describe the uniformity and tidiness of the hedges. This creates and the reader is thus able to imagine the scene clearly. The use of the word   emphasises the all-encompassing nature of the leaves on the hedges, and
this. Therefore, the use of similes by the writer here contributes to the descriptive nature of the text, and creates a more powerful image in the reader’s mind.
Furthermore, the writer uses personification in the phrase “sat side by side like polite well-dressed men” to describe the houses, which creates a vivid picture of the houses, and brings an otherwise dull   . By using personification here, the writer is able to

● The effects of these techniques on the reader are analysed and explained.
● Detailed evidence in the form of quotes is selected from the text.
● Points are fully expanded and linked back to the question.
Q3. One way in which the writer has the text to interest the reader is the use of short sentences with the . As Ugwu and his Aunty are entering the Master’s compound, the writer uses short sentences such as “the lawn glistened” and “butterflies hovered overhead”, in order to create tension within the narrative. Ugwu’s previous state has been one of awe whilst journeying to the compound, however at this point the short sentences in the structure of the text   .

Q4. In this extract, the writer portrays Ugwu’s state as being one of intense awe and excitement. As Ugwu enters the compound, the idyllic tone that previously characterised the text is continued. The writer uses   to describe the idyllic scene as they walk into the compound, detailing the   smell dissipating from the ‘white flowers clustered on

 mother and aunty’s huts being described rather unwelcomingly, through phrases such as the ‘dim coolness’, Ugwu momentarily wishes he could be back there anyway, which further emphasises how anxious he must be feeling.
Once Ugwu and his aunty enter the Master’s room, the writer uses descriptive language with when compared to the language used to describe the entrance. The writer describes the flowers in a vase in the room, creating a direct juxtaposition , in order to convey Ugwu’s
growing disappointment to the reader. Additionally, Ugwu’s impression of the room is that it had ‘too much’ space, sounding more disappointed than the awe-struck state he had been in before.
At the end of the passage, our impression of the Master through Ugwu’s eyes does not live up to the impression the reader has so far been given. The writer’s use of language implies that the Master is rude and obnoxious, and the indicates to the reader that he is uninterested and distracted. Furthermore, the   of the Master sitting in his chair in a

Overall, I would agree with the statement, as throughout the text the writer creates the impression that Ugwu’s sense of excitement is fading into one of disappointment and apprehension at what his new life might entail.

 b) Write a story about a new beginning.
Spring. The time of new life; fields full of baby lambs, a new season, daffodils blooming in the
 fields as the sun melts away the winter frost.
A fresh start for so many.
 As lambs tentatively took their first steps into a new world, Sophie nervously packed her daffodil-coloured suitcase. She felt as shaky as a baby lamb as she folded shirt after shirt, jumper after jumper, and more pairs of shoes than she knew she had. She wondered how on earth it was all going to fit, and more pertinently, how she was going to carry it on the bus ride across London to the airport.
Sighing, Sophie gazed around her tiny flat. It looked so bare and sad, a shadow of what it had once been. The place looked almost sterile now; it had been stripped of any personal touch and the little The

round.
“Do I even need half of this stuff?” She mumbled to herself as she grappled with the unruly zip.
It shut, but not before Sophie had beads of sweat dripping down her face, her curly blonde hair sticking to her face in the most annoying way. Get me out of here, she thought.
Out on the street, the cars were rushing by, the wind smacking Sophie in the face like a ton of bricks. She dragged her suitcase along the busy pavement to the bus stop, trying to dodge the commuters and tourists that littered it, out of breath already by the time she got there. She flopped onto the bench at the bus stop, letting out a long breath. Not once did she turn to look back at her flat, subconsciously closing that chapter in her life.
